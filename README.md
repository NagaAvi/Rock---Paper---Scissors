# Rock---Paper---Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple two-player game where each player chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The objective of the game is to beat the other player by choosing an option that defeats their choice.

In this Python implementation of the game, the computer will randomly choose one of the three options, while the player will enter their choice through the command line interface. The game will then determine the winner based on the following rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
If both the computer and player choose the same option, the game will end in a tie.

To play the game, the player will simply need to run the Python script and follow the prompts to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The game will then display the computer's choice and declare the winner.

This game can be a fun way to practice basic programming concepts such as conditional statements and user input/output, while also providing a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.
